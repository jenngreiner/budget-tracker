## User Story
As an avid traveller, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Description 
The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

## Usage
Open the [Budget Tracker](https://jenngreiner.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler-homework5/) in your browser. All previously added transaction will be displayed in the table and chart on the screen. Enter a transaction name and amount, then click Add or Subtract to update the budget tracker. Transactions posted while your device is offline will still be stored in the app.
